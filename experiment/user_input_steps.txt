Okay, focusing on a conceptual flow without code generation, here's a suggested sequence for handling a user's image upload and a text query in a multi-modal RAG system:
1. Receive User Inputs:
The system takes in the user's text query.
Simultaneously, it receives the uploaded image.

2. Image Pre-processing:
The uploaded image is sent to a Vision-Language Model (VLM).
The VLM generates a detailed textual description or summary of the image content. This converts the visual information into a searchable text format.

3. Query Refinement:
The user's original text query is passed to a Large Language Model (LLM).
This LLM's role is to "expand" or "rewrite" the query, making it more detailed and adding relevant keywords or contextual phrases. This helps in more effective retrieval.

4. Combined Query Formation:
The generated image description (from step 2) and the refined text query (from step 3) are combined into a single, comprehensive search query. The original user query could also be part of this combined input.

5. Multi-Modal Retrieval:
The combined query is then used to perform a search against your vector database (which contains embeddings from various modalities like text, tables, and image summaries/descriptions).
The retrieval process identifies the most semantically relevant chunks of information, which could be pure text, summarized tables, or the textual summaries of images. The similarity scores for these retrieved documents would also be obtained in this step.

6. Context Augmentation:
For each retrieved "chunk" (document, table summary, image summary), its original content is retrieved from a document store. If an image summary was retrieved, the actual image (e.g., as a base64 string) associated with that summary would be fetched.
All these pieces of information – the retrieved text snippets, table data, and actual image data (or references to images) – are then assembled into a single, rich context package.

7. Multi-Modal Answer Generation:
This assembled context (textual data, table data, and image data/references) is then fed, along with the original user query, into a powerful, multi-modal LLM.
The LLM uses all the provided information to synthesize a coherent, comprehensive, and accurate answer, potentially incorporating visual references from the images by generating Markdown image syntax.

8. Present Answer:
The final, multi-modal answer is presented to the user.
