This image shows a Siamese cat being physically restrained on a flat surface by a person using both hands. One hand is securing the catâ€™s forelimbs while the other is holding the hind limbs. The cat appears calm but immobilized, likely in preparation for a medical or experimental procedure. The restraint technique minimizes movement and potential injury to both the handler and the animal, which is crucial in veterinary or laboratory contexts.
