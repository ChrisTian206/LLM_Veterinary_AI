This black-and-white image depicts a man conducting a scientific or medical procedure on a Siamese cat. The man, dressed in a lab coat and kneeling on the floor, appears to be injecting or inserting a device into the catâ€™s leg. The cat is restrained with a harness and two taut cords, likely to minimize movement during the procedure. This scene likely comes from a historical veterinary, neurological, or behavioral research context, possibly mid-20th century, given the setting and photographic style.
