This black-and-white image shows a Siamese cat partially restrained inside a fabric bag with a zipper. Only the catâ€™s head is visible, while its body is fully enclosed. The bag appears to be a type of restraint tool, likely used in veterinary or laboratory settings to safely handle the animal during procedures, such as injections or examinations. A chain attached to the wall suggests the setup may be part of a controlled testing or holding environment.
